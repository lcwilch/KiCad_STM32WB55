Impedance Control Required

1) 50 Ohms (+-10%) Single-Ended Microstrip
L1 (ref. L2)
Trace width = 0.17mm

2) 90 Ohms (+- 10%) Differential Microstrip (50 Ohms (+-10%) Single-Ended))
L1 (ref. L2)
Trace width = 0.17mm
Trace Spacing = 0.22mm

3) 50 Ohms (+-10%) Single-Ended Microstip
L4 (ref. L3)
Trace width = 0.17mm


Confirm trace widths and spacings. Adjust stack-up as necessary.
